    """Python-based abstract representation of a module. All post-processor modules must implement these methods.
    Each module must support a few options for constructing.

    :param type: The type of constructor to be used. Available options are:

    'GUI': The class should interact directly with the user to get required options (default)

    'CLI': Interact with user via CLI, or take info from args.

    :param args: Additional information, which depends on the type of constructor:

    type='GUI': unused

    type='CLI': A full list of arguments passed to the executable, to be interpreted as the module pleases.

    :param wm: A window manager to use for GUI windows during construction

    Notes for implementers of modules:

    * The constructor should not do any computationally intensive tasks. Those should be done in `run`, which
    will be invoked in its own Thread.

    * The `run` method should not interact with the user or display any results (for portability!)
