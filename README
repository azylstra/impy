General Information
===================

This is a post-processor and viewer for hydrodynamics simulations.

The goal is to provide a unified framework for interpretation of results from HYADES, LILAC, and analytic Guderley modeling of implosions. The code is extensible for future addition of other simulation types or post-processor modules. The project is written in python3 and makes heavy use of scipy/numpy for the computational aspects, and tkinter/matplotlib for the user interface.

Development environment requirements:
- python [>=3.3.3]
- numpy [>=1.8.0]
- scipy [>=0.13.2]
- matplotlib [>=1.3.1]
For documentation:
- Sphinx
For building binaries:
- setuptools
